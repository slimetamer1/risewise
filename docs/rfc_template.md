<!--
The RFC is a document, which is the basis for discussion and building consensus.
It is meant to be an evolving document. Sections can be left empty
at first and can be completely removed or filled in as the discussion
unfolds. After building the consensus, a submitted RFC becomes active and
serves as documentation.

Only relevant questions and suggestions in each section have to be addressed.
If a section has no relevant questions or suggestions, it can be omitted.
